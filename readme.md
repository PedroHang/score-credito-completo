# Bank Credit Score Classification Project

### Overview

The trained model in this project results from processing a large set of fictional data of potential BANK customers. The data was processed to feed a classification algorithm based on the decision tree model.

### Details

The process is described in more detail (with visual panels) in the *class-cred.ipynb* file available in the repository. The project inside this repository is in Portuguese (pt-br).

### Recommendations

It is recommended to run the project using Anaconda Navigator. You can download it from the [Anaconda Navigator Download Page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
